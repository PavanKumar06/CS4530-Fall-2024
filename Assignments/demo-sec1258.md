# Specifications for Live Demos / PresentationsÂ (Sections 1, 2, 5, & 8 - Prof. Bhutta)

Each group will present a live demo to show the feature that they have added to Covey.Town for the final project. The schedule of these demos will be discussed/finalized during the lecture. You will have 6 minutes maximum (5 minutes to setup and present. 1 minute for questions and everything else). You will lose points if your demo goes over 6 minutes. Please rehearse it and time yourself (best to keep it to 5 minutes or less). 
Please note:
- The demo MUST be from hosted website, NOT from localhost. 
- Attendance is REQUIRED for these demos. Please email the instructor if you have extenuating circumstances

Your presentation should include the following:
- Description of feature(s) implemented [no more than 1 slide]
- Short summary of overall contributions made by each member [no more than 1 slide with 1-2 sentences per member];
- What percentage of overall contribution was made by each member (perhaps using weekly peer contribution scores) and What is the estimated number of hours spent on the {overall} project by each member excluding research tasks [no more than 1 slide];
- Checklist of all user stories and COS (what was proposed vs what was implemented. Feel free to use percentages to show progress)
- Discuss any deviations from the proposed plan? [no more than 1 slide]

During your presentation, you might want to consider the following order: introduction of project idea/user stories follow by live demo, then present the slides in the order they are listed above or in any order you find appropriate.

You might want to include your email address and other related info (i.e., github repo link, pictures, hosted site link, etc). You will also submit a copy of your presentation (pptx/pdf file, not link) on Canvas.

# Grading Rubric:
Your final Poster and Demos are worth 4% of the overall course. 

Poster will be worth 1% and will be graded based on whether you submitted it on time or not. 

Demos will be worth 3% and will be graded using the following criteria: Each group will evaluate each others' demos and will assign scores (Instructor and TAs will do the same). Your final demo score will be calculated by combining all of these scores (equally weighted). However, you will not receive points for the demo if your group fails to submit copy of the presentation on Canvas, your scores to instructor and if you are not present for all presentations/demos during class.
